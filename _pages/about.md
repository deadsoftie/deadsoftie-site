# Rahul Nair (@deadsoftie)

I'm a Game Developer and 3D Generalist with a background in Computer Science and Media Technology. I have experience contributing to large-scale application development and creating internal tools to improve efficiency. Currently, I'm pursuing my Masters at DigiPen Institute of Technology, focusing on low-level computer graphics and custom game engines, where I am working on an ECS-based custom C++ engine as well as developing an indie game project.
