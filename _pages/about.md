# Rahul Nair (@deadsoftie)

Just an average Game Engine developer with an occasional flair for 3D art. Worked mostly in tech and media, hence love what I am doing now, which is working on games and their engines. Currently a grad student at DigiPen Institute of Technology, focusing on building my custom C++ engine and building my game simulatneously.

> P.S. Although, AI has it's advantages it's pointless to have that on a blog meant to share my thoughts. All the words used here are written by me (a human), there will be grammatical errors and typos, I hope you kind people forgive me for it.
