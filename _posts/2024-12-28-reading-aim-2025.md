As one can make out my resolutions for the year (like most others) starts off with triumphant energy but ends up fizzling right before the start of June. I blame the necessity to try and achieve un-attainable heights. Therefore, for the coming year I plan on having more realistic goals and try reaching them on a safe pace. I guess pushing this out onto a public domain puts more of a pressure to shut up and do things.

**TLDR;** My reading aim for the next year is quite honestly just a mix of stoicism oriented books that have a sprinkle of crime-thriller fiction so that I don't lose hope in life mid-way. A man has to have fun occasionally.

# Shoe Dog - Phil Knight

I have been wanting to read this one for quite some time now. Starting off on a lighter note so that I have the motivation to read. If I start with something more stoic right away I believe I might give before the year even crosses a month. Also a very happy consumer.

# Letters from a Stoic - Seneca
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EVmWoiuaL.jpg" height="500"/>

After scouring Reddit for almost an hour I understood that the unanimous decision lies that Seneca or Epictetus are the best to start off with rather than plunging directly to Aurelius.

# Memory Man - David Baldacci

I have always been really interested in getting into crime thrillers but for some reason whenever I go in to buy a book I end up getting a non-fiction out of habit and fall out of love with it. This year I want to make the conscious decision of actually reading fiction. Plus it will also allow me to take a break from the heavy books in the aim.

# Game Engine Architecture - Jason Gregory

Speaking of heavy books this is one that can arguable be called the bible of game engine development. As someone very interested in working on game engines this is something I want to spend time on to understand on a conceptual level. I am hoping that this book will be a great reference in my work next year.

# Absolute Power - David Baldacci

Yet another Baldacci book to be a filler during my time of void.

# Musashi - Eiji Yoshikawa

Now I must say that this includes a bit of cheating cause I have read the first 12 chapters of Musashi and I loved it. However, this book is well over 900 pages so I have a fair bit to cover and finish off the next time I pick it up.

# The Camel Club - David Baldacci

Heard a lot about the Camel Club series and hoping that this first installation won't disappoint.

# Discourses and Selected Writings - Epictetus

Well continuing on the stoic journey I made the logical conclusion to be starting on Epictetus after finishing the writings of Seneca. Should be dreadfully fun.

# Cryptonomicon - Neal Stephenson

I am not reading this book because of Gilfoyle. Yes, I am reading this book because of Gilfoyle.

# Meditations - Marcus Aurelius

Last but not the least, ending the list with the heavy hitter Aurelius book. Will see how it pans out.

You would have noticed that, one, there are no numbers on the listing while that could have been a stylistic choice it has more to do with reminding me that I can complete this in any order that I wish with no pressure on it's arrangement in this post. Two, that the total number of books comes up to 10, this is because I want to have some leeway in the books that I read without having to think of an arbitrary deadline.

Hoping to have the discipline to go over all of it over the course of the coming year. Happy New Year!
